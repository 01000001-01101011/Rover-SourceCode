# Rover-SourceCode
This is the important code from my project.  The point is to see the code that I wrote, not necessarily to be able to recreate it exactly.  If you do want to recreate it, you can do so quite easily by adding these scripts into your Unity project, setting up a 6 wheeled vehicle, creating a target box, and assigning these scripts to things as needed and adjusting their variables.
